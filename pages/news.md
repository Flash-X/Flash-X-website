# Code Release (2/1/2022)
<p>Argonne National Laboratory and the Flash-X Council are pleased to announce the availability of Flash-X, a new, 
composable multiphysics software, that is designed to be compatible with platform heterogeneity. It is derived 
from FLASH which has been a community code for several science domains over the last 20+ years. Flash-X is 
released under the Apache-2.0 license. To obtain a copy of the software please send email to: <a href="mailto:flash-x@lists.cels.anl.gov">flash-x@lists.cels.anl.gov </a> 
with your github ID. We only give access to the code to GitHub users that become collaborators of the Flash-X repository on GitHub,
because we are required to maintain a list of users cloning the code.</p>

<p>The development and governance of Flash-X is overseen by the Flash-X Council, please click on the Council link
