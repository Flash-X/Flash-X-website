# Obtaining the Code

The source code is hosted at https://github.com/Flash-X/Flash-X

It is distributed under Apache 2.0 license. The repository is not
public, however, because we are required by our funders to maintain a list
of users who obtain the code from the repository.
Therefore you must be a GitHub user and
become a collaborator of the repository to obtain the code from us. Please email
flash-x@lists.cels.anl.gov with your github ID to get access.
