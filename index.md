title: Flash-X
subtitle: A Multiphysics Scientific Software System
---
Flash-X is a highly composable multiphysics software system that can be used to simulate physical phenomena in several scientific domains. It is derived from FLASH, which has been a community code for several communities over the last 20 years. The Flash-X architecture has been redesigned to be compatible with increasingly heterogeneous hardware platforms. A part of the redesign is a utilizing a newly designed performance portability layer that is language agnostic. 

Flash-X is released under the open source Apache 2.0 license. 

**Flash-X is a winner of the R&D 100 awards for 2020**
