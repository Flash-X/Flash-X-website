title: Flash-X
subtitle: A Multiphysics Scientific Software System
---
<p>Flash-X, is a highly composable multiphysics software system that can be used to simulate physical phenomena in 
several scientific domains. It is derived from FLASH, which has been a community code for several communities since
late 1990s and early 2000s. The Flash-X architecture has been redesigned to be compatible with increasingly heterogeneous hardware 
platforms. A part of the redesign is a utilizing a newly designed performance portability layer that is language agnostic.</p>

<p>Flash-X is a recipient of 2022 R&D 100 award, and is released under the open source Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p><center>Flash-X simulates core collapse supernovae by modeling the fluid dynamics, nuclear reactions, and neutrino transport during the collapse and explosion. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) adjusts resolution in key areas, ensuring accurate capture of rapid changes in the star's core and shock fronts.</center></p>

<p><center>Flash-X can also simulate incompressible multiphase flows like pool boiling, vital for cooling systems in car engines and microelectronics. The simulation shows that under Earth's gravity, bubbles depart regularly, but in microgravity, reduced buoyant forces prevent bubble departure, affecting cooling efficiency in space.</center></p>
                                                             
# Flash-X Code of Conduct

<p>All collaborators are expected to be respectful of one another. Discussions and disagreements should remain 
polite and free of abusive language. There will no discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, 
or any other potentially divisive reason. All major code components will have an associated list of authors.</p>

<p>Proper credit must be given to the contributors of code components used in all scientific publications. All code contributors 
will follow the contribution policies and workflow and the coding standards.</p>
