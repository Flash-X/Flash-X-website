title: Flash-X
subtitle: A Multiphysics Scientific Software 
---
Flash-X is a highly composable multiphysics software that can be used to simulate physical phenomena in several scientific domains. It is derived from FLASH, which has been a community code for several communities over the last 20 years. Flash-X architecture has been redesigned to be compatible with increasingly more heterogeneous platforms. A part of the redesign is a utilizing a newly designed performance portability abstract layer that is langauge agnostic. 
Flash-X is released under open source Apache 2.0 license. 


High-fidelity simulations of core collapse supernovae and pool boiling.
